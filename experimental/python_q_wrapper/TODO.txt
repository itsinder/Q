Things to verify
1) run the Q/Python code through a standard Python debugger?
2) run the Q/Python code through Jupyter Notebooks
3) execute individual lVector methods like set_name(), eval(), ...
4) When running through debugger, 
  set breakpoint, 
  execute Q.save(), 
  start CLI, 
  restore meta data in CLI, 
  execute Q.save() again, 
  exit CLI, 
  resume IDE and
  see effect of CLI changes if any
5) Restoring an earlier session
  a) start IDE
  b) do some stuff
  c) execute Q.restore(...)
  d) verify that you can access things in saved session
6) Concatenate operators e.g.,
  x = Q.add(Q.sub(Q.mul(Q.const, {})))
6) Concatenate lVector methods
  x = Q.const, {}):set_name("xxx"):eval()
7) What about creating pScalar to match up with Scalar?
