This is version 1.0 of the Q web app to view meta data
It is semi automated at present.

Target version 1.1 to be fully automated


Steps to use the simple Q web app

1) source Q_SRC_ROOT/setup.sh
2) bash Q_SRC_ROOT/QUI/view_meta_demo.sh or view_meta.sh if global vectors are created by some other script
3) Click on index.html to load the html script on a browser.

Any modifications with vector(s) will call for point 2 again + refreshing the browser.
