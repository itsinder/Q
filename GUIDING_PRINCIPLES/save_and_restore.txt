Save
- Add Q.save() statement at the end of your script ("load.lua", I have added and checked in to git)
- Before running your script, make sure that, Q_METADATA_DIR env variable is set
- After running the "load.lua", all your globals (table, lVector etc) will be saved to file (displayed on console)

Restore
- Run "bash Q/setup.sh -f" to set all required environment variable
- set Q_METADATA_FILE env variable as below to point to saved file
export Q_METADATA_FILE="/root/local/Q/meta/saved.meta"
- CLI session will load all your contents for you
