Following is for writing tests at the Q level
1) First line should be *ONE OR MORE* of the following
-- FUNCTIONAL 
-- NO_OP
-- PERFORMANCE
-- STRESS
-- BUSTED

Note that you can provide multiple labels e.g.,
-- FUNCTIONAL PERFORMANCE

2) Next few lines should be as follows

local Q = require 'Q'
require 'Q/UTILS/lua/strict'

3) Name of file should be test_*.lua. Note that if you have a file
that matches "test_*.lua" but you do not want the test runner to pick
it up, then the firsty line should be -- NO_OP

4) If your script uses other Lua files, then remember to require them in the
usual way e.g.
local helper = require 'Q/UTILS/lua/helper.lua'

5) If your script uses data files, then provide the full path, not the reltive
path e.g.,
local q_src_root = os.getenv("Q_SRC_ROOT")
local data_file = q_src_root .. "/OPERATORS/DATA_LOAD/datafile/file1.csv"

6) Last lines of script should be

require('Q/UTILS/lua/cleanup')()
os.exit()
