Following is for writing tests at the Q level
1) First line should be *ONE OR MORE* of the following
-- FUNCTIONAL 
-- NO_OP
-- PERFORMANCE
-- STRESS

-- FUNCTIONAL PERFORMANCE

2) Next few lines should be as follows

local Q = require 'Q'
require 'Q/UTILS/lua/strict'

3) Name of file should be test_*.lua. Note that if you have a file
that matches "test_*.lua" but you do not want the test runner to pick
it up, then the firsty line should be -- NO_OP

require('Q/UTILS/lua/cleanup')()
os.exit()
