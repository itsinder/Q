- Remove unnecessary ffi definition 
- Put nils for columns that you do not want to load
- bufsize should be calculated from c data
- if column_list[colidx] == nil then continue end
- remove column_list length, as it might contain null values
- create list and return that , not this
- README.sh should be updated to include only the minimal things which is helpful for developer. 
- Testcase needs to be updated as per the new format
