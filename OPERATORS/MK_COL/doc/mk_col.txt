Sometimes, we need to create a column on the fly, without having 
to load it from a table. This is usually the case when one has a small number of
values thay one wants to create a column out of. 
For example, x = mk_col({10, 20, 30, 40}, "I4") should return a column consisting of
4 rows, where each cell is a 4-byte integer and the values of 
x[0] = 10
x[1] = 20
x[2] = 30
x[3] = 40

This should be a simple modification of the functionality in load_csv

Couple of notes. We will support only the following types
I1
I2
I4
I8
F4
F8
SC -- can be pushed till later if time is short

A column so created, by definition, has no null values.
