\label{vectors}

A vector is essentially a map \(f(i)\) such that given \(i, 0 \leq i < n\), it
returns a value of a given type. Q currently supports the following types
\be
\item I1, 1 byte signed integer
\item I2, 2 byte signed integer
\item I4, 4 byte signed integer
\item I8, 8 byte signed integer
\item F4, single precision floating point
\item F8, double precision floating point
\item B1, bit vector
