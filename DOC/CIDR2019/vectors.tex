\section{Vectors}
\label{vectors}

A vector is essentially a map \(f(i)\) such that given \(i, 0 \leq i < n\), it
returns a value of a given type. The main types that \Q\ supports four variants
of integers (1, 2, 4, and 8 byte) and two variations of floating point (single
and double precision). In addition, it supports bit vectors, constant length
strings. There is limited support for variable length strings, which are used
primarily as dictionaries.
