\section{Future Work}

Currently, memory mapped files serve two purposes --- to provide the illusion of
a linear address space and to ``memo-ize'' a Vector so that any chunk of it, not
just the current one, can be recalled. We would like to investigate alternate
storage strategies such as \cite{ramcloud2009}.

We have presented operators that consume more inputs than they produce and vice
versa. We would like to generalize Q's streaming computations to writing
programs as directed acylic graphs, where data is
pumped through on every ``clock''.

We have started porting Q to CUDA. \TBC
