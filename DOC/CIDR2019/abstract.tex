\begin{abstract}
The unspoken secret of ``big data'' is that while data warehouses are
exploding in size, the actual amount of data needed for many analytics and
machine learning problems is better characterized as ``medium data''. We define
``medium data'' as data large enough that one must be cognizant of performance but small
enough that a single machine is adequate. This realization has motivated the
design and development of Q, an analytical database. Q can be thought of as both
a programming language and a storage engine. The language is inspired by
Ousterhout's dichotomy, using a scripting language (Lua) with a fast interpreter
(LuaJIT) as the front-end and a compiled language (C) for the back-end.
A fundamental realization that has influenced Q's design is that data
practitioners often build up tremendous intuition about the data sets that they
are working with. Q encourages the use of this intuition to gain performance.
Q exposes its software architecture to the more
adventurous programmer, providing performance gains to the programmer willing to
invest more time in relatively simple tweaks.
By using a simple data model that is accessible to the programmer, Q makes it
easy to integrate high performance custom code when necessary.
