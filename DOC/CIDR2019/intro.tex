Reference to Lua \cite{Lua2011}.

Similar to Tcl/Tk \cite{Ousterhout2009} in that the Tcl interpreter 
was implemented as a library of C procedures, where applications 
built using Tcl could extend the core functionality easily.

Mention multi stage programming

Multi-stage programming (MSP) is a variety of metaprogramming in which
compilation is divided into a series of intermediate phases, allowing typesafe
run-time code generation. Statically defined types are used to verify that
dynamically constructed types are valid and do not violate the type system.
