\section{Q's Run Time System}

Q is a high-performance ``almost-relational'' 
analytical, single-node, column-store database. 
\be
\item 
By ``analytical'' we mean that data changes at the user's behest (e.g.,
loading a data set) but is not subject to external events.
\item 
By ``almost-relational'' we mean that it would more correctly
be called a ``tabular model'' \cite{Codd1982}. As Codd states, ``Tables are
at a lower level of abstraction than relations, since they give
the impression that positional (array-type) addressing is applicable
(which is not true of \(n\)-ary relations), and they fail to
show that the information content of a table is independent
of row order. Nevertheless, even with these minor 
aws,
tables are the most important conceptual representation of
relations, because they are universally understood.''
\item By ``single-node'', we mean that Q does not distribute computation across
  machines. The flow of execution is inherently single-threaded. However,
  pthreads and OpenMP are heavily used {\em within} individual operations so as
  to exploit multi-core systems as well as GPUs (Section~\ref{end}).
\item By ``column-store'', we mean that 
Q provides the Lua programmer with the Vector type, each
individual element of which is a Scalar. A database table is modeled as a Lua
table of Vectors (Section~\ref{vectors_versus_tables}.
