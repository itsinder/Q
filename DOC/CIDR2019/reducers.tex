\section{Reducers}
\label{reducers}

A reducer is a construct that takes one or more vectors as input and produces
one or more scalars as output. The simplest Reducers are those for min, max, sum
and other associative functions. In this case, the reducer returns 2 values,one
being the value of the function being computed and the other being the number of
non-null values observed.
