\section{Conclusion}
\label{end}

The development of Q has been motivated by understanding, as data 
science practitioners, of what is truly needed to be
effective. We have found that engaging the user at the right level of abstraction, rather than shielding them from
system internals, makes for simple, performant code. It has allowed for the
rapid deployment of highly performant analytical capabilities that 
service the needs of the business in a timely manner. At the same time, Q's
parsimonious use of computing resources shows that the pursuit of a profit
motive is not inconsistent with a recognition that computing uses 
material and energy resources \cite{Limits2018} and that there are 
``planetary boundaries that must not be transgressed'' \cite{Rockstrom2009}.
